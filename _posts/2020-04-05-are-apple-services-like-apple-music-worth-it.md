No need to explain my apple love as from the past six years, I am using the Apple ecosystem for my daily tasks. Apple turned to service bases company as well.

Now here in the USA, they offer

* Apple Arcade (Gaming Subscription)
* Apple Music (Music Subscription)
* Apple News+ (News Subscription)
* Apple TV+ ( Streaming Subscription)
* Apple iCloud Storage (Storage Subscription)

**Here’s what I think about these services**

* **Apple Music** suggestions are not that great for Hindi songs for English; it’s okay, not the best.
* **Apple News+** is excellent for readers as it clubs all famous newspapers and magazines at a single place and arranges articles as per the reader’s choice, plus you can share it with the family of 6 ppl for free and costs monthly $9.90 which I think it is fair pricing.
* **Apple iCloud** pricing is the same for almost all regions and also reasonably priced as 50GB for $0.99/mo
* **Apple TV+** has minimal shows, and it’s not worth it. Apple gave it for free for one year; maybe they know charging for this service $4.99/mo is not fair as of now.
* **Apple Arcade** is suitable for gamers and also costs $4.99/mo
